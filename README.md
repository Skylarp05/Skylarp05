**🩶 About me 🩶**
- Pre-Financial Analyst, Auditor    
- MS in Business Analyst @University of Minnesota & Corporate Finance @Penn State  
- BS in Accounting

**🤍 Quick Wrap Up 🤍**   
From Accounting/Auditing to Corporate Finance to Data Science... Such a long journey but it's been filled with joy and adventure every step of the way.  
Accounting/auditing has endowed me with unparalleled numerical sensitivity.   
Corporate finance introduced me to the art of modeling(DCF, M&A, Trading Compos Modeling...).  
Data science has empowered me to handle vast amounts of data, uncover patterns, make predictions, derive actionable insights, and much more beyond numbers!
